  <p><strong>About JobMaps</strong><br/>
  To begin, we are four undergrad students joining forces 
  to help employers and job seekers; post and search for jobs based
  primarily on location.
 </p>
  <p><strong>Our Goals</strong><br />
    Our main key feature and attractiveness of the site is the map to focus on job search by location,
    for those whose main focus is for a job based on location. This site is designed to make location<br/>
    based job search effortless and enjoyable,
    while still having full functionality as other job posting sites.
